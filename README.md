# Care Transition Efficiency & Placement Outcomes Analysis
Detailed guide and project requirements for the Care Transition Efficiency & Placement Outcome Analytics analysis.

## Background Context 
The UAC Program operates as a multi-stage care and reunification pipeline, not just a healthcare system. Losing existing customers leads to:
The pipeline consists of:

• Apprehension & CBP custody
• Transfer to HHS care
• Medical screening, sheltering, and case management
• Discharge and reunification with a vetted sponsor
From a policy and humanitarian perspective, speed, continuity, and reliability of this pipeline are as critical as capacity.

## Problem Statement
While aggregate counts of children in custody are monitored, process efficiency metrics are largely absent.
Key unanswered questions include:

• How efficiently are children transferred from CBP to HHS?
• Are discharges keeping pace with inflows?
• When and where do care backlogs accumulate?
• Are placement outcomes improving or deteriorating over time?
Without structured transition analytics, system bottlenecks remain hidden.
## Project Objectives
• Measure efficiency of CBP → HHS transitions
• Evaluate discharge and sponsor placement outcomes
• Identify delays and process bottlenecks
## Secondary Objectives
• Support faster reunification
• Improve case management workflows
• Inform policy-level process reforms
